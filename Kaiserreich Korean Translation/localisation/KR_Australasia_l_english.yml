AST_oversized_fleet:0 "비대한 함대"
AST_oversized_fleet_desc:0 "영국의 몰락의 혼란스러운 여파로, 많은 배가 피난처를 찾기 위해 호주로 도망 쳤다. 이러한 조치는 영구적인 것이 되었으며, 현재의 경제 상황으로는 상황을 개선하기가 어렵다. 해결책을 곧 찾아내야 한다."

AST_depression_1:0 "경제 불황"
AST_depression_1_desc:0 "오스트랄라시아의 경제는 결코 튼튼하다 할 수 없었으며, 대전의 여파는 경제를 훨씬 더 악화시켰을 뿐이다. 기회는 존재하지 않았고, 사람들은 직업을 찾을 수 없었다. 보다 극단적인 해결책이 고려되기 시작함에 따라 극단주의자들이 전국에 뿌리를 내리기 시작했다."
AST_depression_2:0 "불황에서 회복하다"
AST_depression_2_desc:0 "오스트랄라시아의 경제는 결코 튼튼하다 할 수 없었으며, 대전의 여파는 경제를 훨씬 더 악화시켰을 뿐이다. 기회는 존재하지 않았고, 사람들은 직업을 찾을 수 없었다. 보다 극단적인 해결책이 고려되기 시작함에 따라 극단주의자들이 전국에 뿌리를 내리기 시작했다."
AST_bled_dry:0 "너무도 많은 피를 흘리다"
AST_bled_dry_desc:0 우리는 대전기에 모든 것을 쏟아 부었고, 결판이 났다. 거의 모든 사람들이 결국엔 아무 의미 없이 고향에서 멀리 떨어진 곳에서 죽어나간 사람이 있다는 것을 알고 있고, 그것이 절대적으로 필요하지 않는 한 그런 일이 일어나는 것을 다시는 보고 싶어 하지 않는다."

AST_anzac_spirit_1_desc:0 "대전기에, 오스트레일리아와 뉴질랜드 출신들은 가장 공격적이었으며, 의심스러운 규율에도 불구하고 그들의 조직을 유지했다. 의심할 여지 없이 그들은 도를 넘을 정도로 다루기 어려웠지만, 그들은 막상 전투를 즐겼다. 그들은 강인함과 감정적임의 흥미로운 조화였다."

### Focuses ###
AST_democracy_prevails:0 "민주 오스트랄라시아"
AST_democracy_prevails_desc:0 "민주주의는 오스트랄라시아에 만연하고, 이 순간, 권력은 의회의 손 안에 남아 있으며 이는 국민들이 권력을 가지고 있음을 뜻합니다. 국가가 마주친 어려움은 많지만, 자유는 우리가 조심하지 않으면 너무나도 쉽게 우리의 손을 빠져 나갑니다."
AST_freedom_of_the_press:0 "언론의 자유"
AST_freedom_of_the_press_desc:0 "국민들의 통제를 수월하게 하기 위해, 버드우드의 정권은 1926년에 검열 법을 시행했다. 이 법을 폐지하는 것은 거의 예상 되었는데, 이 나라가 다시 한번 민주화되었기 때문이다… 비록 오스트랄라시아의 신문이 자유롭게 말할 수 있음을 느끼기까지 오랜 시간이 걸리긴 했지만.  그들이 누가 그들을 얶메는 것을 풀어 주었는지 기억하기를 빌자."
AST_trade_union_question:0 "노동 조합의 거취에 대해"
AST_trade_union_question_desc:0 "멜버른 코뮨의 후유증으로, 노동 조합은 불법이 되었다. 그들의 사상에 대한 많은 회의적 시각이 있지만, 지속된 버드우드의 압제적인 정책 시행은 확실히 인기가 없으며, 그러므로 우리는 노동 조합이 현대 오스트랄라시아 사회에서 가질 위치에 대해 결정해야 한다."
AST_lift_martial_law:0 "계엄령을 해제하다"
AST_lift_martial_law_desc:0 "국가가 성립되었을 때부터, 오스트랄라시아는 실질적인 계엄령 상태 하에 있었다. 이제 민주주의가 부활했고 의회가 권력을 가지고 있으니, 정부는 오스트랄라시아에 민간 자유를 부활시킬 수 있는 위치에 있다."
AST_suppress_syndicalism:0 "생디칼리스트들을 억압하다"
AST_suppress_syndicalism_desc:0 "결정은 확고하다:생디칼리즘은 국가가 마주한 가장 큰 위협이고, 그러므로 오스트랄라시아 노동 조합 의회는 총력을 다해 억압해야 한다. 노조가 이런 급진 세력의 손에 넘어간 이상 타협은 있을 수 없다."
AST_workers_deal:0 "노동자들과의 타협"
AST_workers_deal_desc:0 "오스트랄라시아의 노동 문제가 문제를 일으키려고 하는 급진적인 상징 주의자들보다 더 크다는 것을 인식할 때가 되었다. 우리가 협상할 수 있는 노조 지도자들이 있으며, 시간이 지나면서 좀 더 공정한 사회를 만들고 급진 주의자들의 세력을 약화시키는 해결책을 강구하는 것이 가능하다."
AST_call_for_unity:0 "통합을 촉구하다"
AST_call_for_unity_desc:0 "1939년 선거가 끝나고 오스트랄라시아에서 민주주의가 영속적인 세력이라는 것이 입증됨에 따라, 오스트랄라시아 국민들은 단결하여 충돌을 피할 수 있도록 촉구할 때가 되었다. 우리는 하나 된 국가로, 새로운 세계에 용감하게 행진해야 한다."
AST_labour_resolved:0 "노동자들의 위협이 종결되다"
AST_labour_resolved_desc:0 "우리는 20세기에 적정 선을 넘어선 노동 분규를 참아 왔고, 이제 우리 역사의 그 한 장을 끝낼 때가 왔다."
AST_maori_act:0 "마오리 법안"
AST_maori_act_desc:0 "뉴질랜드의 마오리족이 소유한 땅의 대부분은 경제적으로 비효율적이다. 다수가 이 불모지를 산업과 상업이 발달된 곳으로 바꾸자고 제안하고 있다. 하지만, 뉴질랜드 사람들은 이러한 제안에 크게 반대하고, 이 땅에 대한 마오리족의 권리가 법으로 보장되기를 원한다. 우리가 어느 것을 더 중요하게 생각하는지에 대해서 곧 결정해야 한다."
AST_long_live_the_king:0 "국왕 폐하 만세!"
AST_long_live_the_king_desc:0 "영국의 영연방과 그에 속한 우리의 위치를 재정립 해야 할 때가 왔다. 몇몇 사람들은 우리가 왕관에 등을 돌려야 한다고 주장하지만, 우리는 지금, 그리고 항상 왕의 충실한 신하라고 말한다. 연방 만세!"
AST_increase_british_ties:0 "영국계와의 관계를 강화하다"
AST_increase_british_ties_desc:0 우리는 더 이상 영국의 직접적인 통치가 필요하지 않지만, 우리의 미래가 영국의 원조에 크게 의존하고 있다는 것을 깨닫지 못하는 것은 어리석은 행동이 될 것이다. 우리는 조언자들이 우리의 군사 연구를 진척시켜 우리가 영국의 동맹에 더 나은 한 부분이 될 수 있도록 도와 줄 것을 요구해야 한다."
AST_australasian_republic:0 "공화국이 되다"
AST_australasian_republic_desc:0 "우리가 영국의 식민지로 시작한 것은 사실이며, 우리는 영원히 우리의 모국에서부터 의 기원을 잊어서는 안된다. 하지만, 우리는 영국인들이 우리 나라에서 행한 강압적인 태도를 무시할 수는 없으며… 우리 쪽 사람들도 마찬가지이다.  우리의 정치 제도를 의회 통치의 구조에서 점잖게 빠져 나와 진정한 공화국이 될 때가 왔다."
AST_new_constitution:0 "새로운 헌법"
AST_new_constitution_desc:0 "공화국이 되는 것은 절차와 개인 시민의 권리에 관한 많은 질문을 제기하는 것을 의미한다. 오스트랄라시아의 의 헌법은 다시 쓰여질 필요가 있을 것이며, 우리는 이 기회를 통해 우리가 다음 세기와 그 이후까지 이끌 수 있는 정부를 만들 수 있다."
AST_we_march_forward:0 "우리는 앞으로 나아간다"
AST_we_march_forward_desc:0 "자유로운 정의로운 사회인 오스트랄라시아의 모든 시민들을 위해 존재하며, 그들 중 어느 누구도 차별 받지 않는 독립국으로 서의 우리의 위상을 경축하자."

AST_syndicalist_victory:0 "생디칼리스트들의 승리"
AST_syndicalist_victory_desc:0 "우리는 자본가들의 손으로부터 승리를 쟁취해야만 했습니다. 더 이상 오스트랄라시아 사람들은 수백 혹은 수천 명의 탐욕스러운 부자들의 천국을 위해 목숨을 희생하지 않을 것입니다! 이제 혁명이 오스트랄라시아까지 찾아왔습니다. 우리는 이 기회를 놓치지 않을 것입니다!"
AST_purge_army:0 "군의 숙청"
AST_purge_army_desc:0 "우리가 직면한 첫 번째 위협은 내부에 있습니다. 군부는 군주제 지지자와 군주제 지지자와 노동자들에게 맞서는 사람들로 가득 차있습니다. 그것이 정리의 시기를 의미한다고 할지라도, 우리는 군을 개혁하고 우리를 지지하기를 거부하는 모든 군 지도부들을 해임해야만 합니다. 
AST_british_advisors:0 "브리튼 고문단 초청"
AST_british_advisors_desc:0 "If there is a Britain to whom we should be loyal, let it be to the one who controls the home isles. The crown might call them traitors, but they are the British people! How can they betray themselves? Let us invite the Union of Britain to join us in marching together towards a new future."
AST_empower_ACTU:0 "Empower the ACTU"
AST_empower_ACTU_desc:0 "The Australasian Council of Trade Unions saw us to this point, sheltered the activists and the labour leaders even as they were being hunted down by the police. Now we shall lift them up and give them the power they deserve, a place to oversee the future and well-being of the Australasian worker."
AST_restore_order_1:0 "The Syndicalists Restore Order"
AST_restore_order_1_desc:0 "It has been a difficult road, but now the chaos must end. No more demonstrations, no more violence that cuts off our own nose to spite our face. The path forward lies with the revolution, and the nation must now face that fact."
AST_syndicalist_congress:0 "The Syndicalist Congress"
AST_syndicalist_congress_desc:0 "The ACTU Congress has seen the syndicalists remain in command. With our future clear, let us plan out future progress for the nation."
AST_establish_ASRC:0 "Establish the ASRC"
AST_establish_ASRC_desc:0 "The Australasian Syndicalist Revolutionary Council will oversee the implementation of our policies throughout the nation, changing the lives of every ordinary citizen... and also ensuring that no upstart radicals and monarchists gain a foothold in places of power. True freedom requires vigilance!"
AST_workers_unite:0 "Unite the Workers"
AST_workers_unite_desc:0 "So many decades of brainwashing have left many of the nation's workers unable to tell what truly lies in their own interests. We must make a concerted effort to re-educate and win them over to the syndicalist cause. The workers of Australasia must be united as a single force!"
AST_totalist_congress:0 "The Totalist Congress"
AST_totalist_congress_desc:0 "The ACTU Congress has seen the maximists take their rightful place as captains of the revolution. Now it is time to stride forward and plot out our nation's future progress."
AST_seize_production:0 "Socialisation of the Nation"
AST_seize_production_desc:0 "Charting the economic future of the nation and its workers means we are prepared to exercise most vigorous and far-reaching control over the economy, to ensure that what is produced is exactly what the country needs."
AST_mobilize_revolution:0 "Mobilise the Revolution"
AST_mobilize_revolution_desc:0 "The workers of Australasia need to understand that holding onto their rights means defending the revolution. Indeed, we must export the revolution elsewhere. It is only when the workers of the entire world are free that we will be able to relax our guard."
AST_business_leaders:0 "The New Business Leaders"
AST_business_leaders_desc:0 "There is a curious perception that only capitalism can see civilian industry progress, and we must dispel that archaic notion. Business leaders must either be re-educated or they must be put aside, as true productivity lies in the hands of the nation's workers."
AST_industrial_progress:0 "Progress in Industry"
AST_industrial_progress_desc:0 "Australasia will make a great leap forward in its industrial capacity, so that production and distribution will be developed in an orderly manner to ensure that our people could enjoy a steadily rising standard in material and cultural conditions."
AST_join_internationale:0 "Join the Internationale"
AST_join_internationale_desc:0 "The time has come to take our place amidst our brothers and sisters of the international syndicalist community. Together we shall be invincible!"

AST_AFM_victory:0 "Victory for the AFM"
AST_AFM_victory_desc:0 "The people have spoken, and now it is time for Australasia to turn its back on a history of colonial oversight and cruelty. No longer will we fight wars in distant lands that shed Australasian blood to no good purpose. Our destiny is our own, and we will not waste this opportunity!"
AST_total_control:0 "Seize Total Control"
AST_total_control_desc:0 "The first step in restoring order is in eliminating the endless debate and controversy that surrounds parliament. The AFM requires total control in order to enact its mandate, and if that means ending elections to impose much-needed reforms on the nation, then so be it! Rights and procedures can be re-introduced at a later date, once Australasia has been transformed."
AST_propaganda_effort:0 "Focus on Propaganda"
AST_propaganda_effort_desc:0 "There are far too many voices in the crowds who would seek to tear down our efforts before they even begin. We must sell the message of the AFM across the nation, and win over even those who did not vote for us in the election."
AST_cut_british_ties:0 "Cut Ties with the Crown"
AST_cut_british_ties_desc:0 "Memories of Gallipoli still run strong in Australasia, and cries of 'never again!' are not enough. We must cut ties with the British not only in terms of our government, but also with our economy and our military alliances. Our nation must stand on its own, and from this day forth we will never again send our sires to the slaughter in a war of European Imperialism."
AST_restore_order_2:0 "The AFM Restores Order"
AST_restore_order_2_desc:0 "It has been a difficult road, but now the chaos must end. No more demonstrations, no more violence that cuts off our own nose to spite our face. The path forward lies with the AFM, and the nation must now face that fact."
AST_social_reforms:0 "New Social Reforms"
AST_social_reforms_desc:0 "The old Imperialist 'democratic' government never pushed nor strived for true equality, one where the women and minorities stand side by side with the rest of their countrymen to help build a future for us all. We will demonstrate what a truly free Australasia looks like."
AST_white_australasia:0 "End White Australasia"
AST_white_australasia_desc:0 "The White Australasia policy began with the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 but didn't end there, and encompasses laws enacted specifically to ensure non-Europeans had a difficult time emigrating to the nation. The time has come to dismantle these laws, even if some people might not like it. Australasia needs to grow, and it must do so as a free society."
AST_monarchist_officers:0 "The Monarchist Officers"
AST_monarchist_officers_desc:0 "The military is filled with officers loyal to the monarchist regime, and the time has come to remove them from their posts. It will mean a difficult transition period, but we need a military that is committed to Australasia and Australasia alone, not one where the threat of British interference or even a coup remains dangling over the head of our leaders like the Sword of Damocles."
AST_fortress_australasia:0 "Fortress Australasia"
AST_fortress_australasia_desc:0 "Our nation must have strong borders, an unassailable island that no enemy would dare to invade. We must be a tower of strength, and prove to the rest of the world that we have no need of British protection - only the seas and the determination of our fearless soldiers."
AST_state_economy:0 "Enact the State Economy"
AST_state_economy_desc:0 "Unfettered capitalism is what led to our sorry state, and thus new laws must be enacted to ensure that the Australasian economy is guided by the government and a single principle: that it work towards the betterment of us all."
AST_new_trade_office:0 "The New Trade Office"
AST_new_trade_office_desc:0 "Australasian trade practices are littered with the remnants of our colonial past: bureaucrats who are all too used to providing favoritism to the Commonwealth instead of seeking fair deals and profits. We must clear them out and forge a new trade office that puts our own nation and the good of its people ahead of an old boys' network that is a relic of the past."
AST_on_our_own:0 "On Our Own"
AST_on_our_own_desc:0 "We have no need of allies - Australasia is a nation that will stand on its own, and assume a position of neutrality and strength."
AST_ties_with_japan:0 "Ties With Japan"
AST_ties_with_japan_desc:0 "If we are to look for closer ties to a power closer to home, we need look no further than the mighty nation of Japan to the north. With the White Australasia policy ended, we have demonstrated our willingness to view Asian neighbors with an equal eye... and now we must entreat them to look on us as a place where business can be done."
AST_united_we_stand:0 "United We Stand"
AST_united_we_stand_desc:0 "Let us celebrate our status as a free and just republic, no longer under the yoke of colonial masters and subject to their endless wars and cruelty. We stand united in a hostile world, boldly marching into the future with no-one to tell us otherwise."

AST_new_guard_victory:0 "Victory for the Guard"
AST_new_guard_victory_desc:0 "Australasia faces many grave dangers - foreign powers that would see us ground down, syndicalists who lie to our workers and would see our nation plunged into chaos. We will not abandon our traditions and our history for the sake of flashy revolution. Order must be maintained for the sake of all Australasians, and we will see our nation shine like never before!"
AST_paramilitary_groups:0 "Create the Secret Police"
AST_paramilitary_groups_desc:0 "The problem with the old governments is that they were unwilling to do what needed to be done in order to secure Australasia's safety - and that means watching the people carefully for any signs of syndicalist activism and revolt. Notions of freedom are quaint, but they pale in comparison to the needs of security."
AST_reaffirm_alliance:0 "Reaffirm the Entente Alliance"
AST_reaffirm_alliance_desc:0 "There are some within the Commonwealth who would look on our actions and wonder, but we must reaffirm that we are doing this for the greater good. We do not wish to fall prey to the same mistakes that led to the loss of the Home Isles, and we will show them that we wish to be a strong and effective ally in the fight to come."
AST_crush_syndicalists:0 "Crush the Syndicalists"
AST_crush_syndicalists_desc:0 "There must be no mercy shown to the syndicalists. The way they have entranced the common man, leading them into actions which only endanger us all, must come to an immediate end. We shall have strength and common purpose, and it will come through the shedding of blood."
AST_restore_order_3:0 "The Australasian Guard Restores Order"
AST_restore_order_3_desc:0 "It has been a difficult road, but now the chaos must end. No more demonstrations, no more violence that cuts off our own nose to spite our face. The path forward lies with the Australasian Guard and with tradition, and the nation must now face that fact."
AST_new_guard_officers:0 "We Need Loyal Officers"
AST_new_guard_officers_desc:0 "So many experienced officers from the Weltkrieg have been put aside, shown the door despite all the loyalty they have shown to our king and country. It is time to bring them back, and show once and for all that dedication to the nation's well-being is the first and primary qualification for leading our troops."
AST_rouse_the_masses:0 "Rouse the Masses"
AST_rouse_the_masses_desc:0 "The people of Australasia are asleep, lulled into a false sense of safety by the thought that they do not have to fight, that wars in distant lands have no bearing on their future. We will dispel that notion, by force if we must. They must all stand, for the king and for country, and the world shall hear us roar!"
AST_royal_advisors:0 "The Royal Advisers"
AST_royal_advisors_desc:0 "We intend to be good allies, and to that end we should invite more advisers to see us through the tough times ahead. Let us lean on our allies as they would lean on us."
AST_a_renewed_call:0 "A Renewed Call to Arms"
AST_a_renewed_call_desc:0 "If the Home Isles are to be secured, if the tyranny of syndicalism is to be stopped in its tracks, we must awaken our sense of pride and strength and enlist for the battle to come. Remember Gallipoli, yes, but remember it as a sacrifice to honour and as a baptism in fire which has forged our nation. We will all make such sacrifices in the years to come."
AST_laissez_faire_reforms:0 "Laissez Faire Reforms"
AST_laissez_faire_reforms_desc:0 "The socialist urge to restrict and regulate has put a stranglehold on our economy. The time has come to undo those policies, and see the corporations of Australasia grow as they were meant to."
AST_the_new_plan:0 "The New Plan for Australasia"
AST_the_new_plan_desc:0 "We will offer a new deal to the people of our nation: the right to have a job, the right to rise as far as they are capable, the right to work for a better future... so long as it does not come at the expense of our traditions or at the expense of our security. These are our watchwords, and they will give us comfort just as they give us prosperity."
AST_a_rising_power:0 "A Rising Power"
AST_a_rising_power_desc:0 "We are not declaring our independence from the Empire - far from it. We are, however, asserting ourselves as a regional power within that Empire. Australasia is a strong nation, and a confident member of the Entente, with interests of its own even as they serve those of the king. This is our path forward."
AST_serve_the_empire:0 "To Serve the Empire"
AST_serve_the_empire_desc:0 "We hereby affirm that Australasia's path lies with that of the king and the Commonwealth. We are, now and forever more, a loyal member of the Empire and will seek to defend it both here at home as well as elsewhere in the world. Together we will find our path to freedom and true security."
AST_the_future_is_ours:0 "The Future is Ours"
AST_the_future_is_ours_desc:0 "Let us celebrate our hard-won survival and victory, a proud member of the Commonwealth and a bastion against the predations of syndicalism and tyranny.

AST_state_of_the_economy:0 "State of the Economy"
AST_state_of_the_economy_desc:0 "The Australasian economy has been suffering from a severe depression for the last five years. We must assess where opportunities lie, and prepare our industry to be properly expanded if we're to have any hope of pulling ourselves out of this quagmire."
AST_liberalize_economy:0 "Liberalise the Economy"
AST_liberalize_economy_desc:0 "The solution to our economies woes is to liberalise our laws - allow more access for foreign investors, as well as reduce the amount of regulations which stifle our business sectors."
AST_privatization:0 "Privatise the Failing Public Sector"
AST_privatization_desc:0 "Almost all of the publicly-owned companies are doing poorly, suffering from mismanagement and even corruption. Rather than revise their practices, perhaps it's best to put them back in the hands of the private sector where they can be run by proper businessmen rather than bureaucrats."
AST_reform_government:0 "Reform the Bureaucracy"
AST_reform_government_desc:0 "The main problem facing our economy is the sheer magnitude of the governmental bureaucracy, laden down by archaic rules and focused on colonial exploitation rather than efficiency. We need a modern government which can respond to issues before they can turn into the catastrophe which faces us now, not well after."
AST_railway_network:0 "The New Railways"

AST_urban_expansion:0 "Urban Expansion"
AST_urban_expansion_desc:0 "Australasia's cities are already growing rapidly - we must enact policies which will encourage the migration of people from the rural areas into urban ones. If our industrial base is to grow, it will need a ready source of workers ready to man the factories."
AST_new_resources_1:0 "Wealth of the Antipodes"
AST_new_resources_1_desc:0 "Australia and New Zealand both have massive, untapped resources which need only to be found and properly exploited. Ours is a dominion of mineral wealth which few other countries can hope to compare to... or, at least, it could be."
AST_new_markets:0 "Seek New Markets"
AST_new_markets_desc:0 "Rather than stick to our traditional trade partners, perhaps we should make an effort to find other countries that would make for a ready home for Australasian goods? America, Japan, Germany... really, the list is almost endless, and surely remaining solely within the Commonwealth is what has gotten us into our current mess?"
AST_trade_commonwealth:0 "Trade With the Commonwealth"
AST_trade_commonwealth_desc:0 "The Commonwealth is where our trade currently lies, and there is plenty more we could do to ensure these bonds become even stronger. We must seek out new trade agreements within the Empire, so that even as we grow stronger so will they."
AST_end_of_depression:0 "End of the Depression"
AST_end_of_depression_desc:0 "Finally we have pulled ourselves out of the doldrums of depression. Australasia can march into the future, its economy a shining example for others to follow."
AST_civ_industry_1:0 "The New Industrial Act"
AST_civ_industry_1_desc:0 "A large number of our outdated rules actually hinder industrial growth. A new law should be introduced to remove those impediments, and arrange a system of incentives to companies which will erect large-scale factories in our cities."
AST_civ_industry_2:0 "Industrialise the South"
AST_civ_industry_2_desc:0 "Southern Australasia has lagged behind the more cosmopolitan regions in New South Wales, and a campaign should be initiated to promote the south to catch up."
AST_mil_industry_1:0 "Australasian Armaments"
AST_mil_industry_1_desc:0 "Up until now, most armaments have been imported from the rest of the Commonwealth. The rise of a proper armament industry will require a great deal of planning and funding, but it is absolutely necessary for the nation's future."
AST_mil_industry_2:0 "Fund the Munitions Plants"
AST_mil_industry_2_desc:0 "Our soldiers' guns and our pilots' planes won't do very much without bullets and bombs. We must start encouraging the growth of a real munitions industry in Australasia."
AST_infrastructure_1:0 "Get our Men Back at Work"
AST_infrastructure_1_desc:0 "Our nation encompasses vast swaths of open land, and crossing them is the most important part of encouraging economic growth.

AST_computer_focus:0 "Focus on Computers"
AST_computer_focus_desc:0 "Computer technology is in its infancy, but already we can see the benefits it offers to encryption and decryption efforts. Australasia needs to stay ahead of this, or our enemies will end up knowing our moves long before we do."

AST_state_of_the_navy_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, the Royal Australian Navy was a small force that consisted of only a few small ships, and plans were to decommission even these as soon as the war ended. With the British Pacific Fleet having fled to our ports, we found ourselves in possession of a fleet that far outstrips our ability to properly manage them. This is our first and foremost issue."
AST_upgrade_facilities:0 "Upgrade Naval Facilities"

AST_cockatoo_island:0 "Rebuild Cockatoo Island"
AST_cockatoo_island_desc:0 "Cockatoo Island in Sydney Harbour has been the most important shipyard in Australasia since the mid-1800's. It should be refitted and expanded to accommodate more and larger vessels."
AST_overhaul_RAN:0 "Overhaul the RAN"

AST_upgrade_reserve:0 "Upgrade the Reserves"
AST_upgrade_reserve_desc:0 "Almost half of the larger ships in the Pacific Fleet were mothballed after the Weltkrieg ended, as we simply did not have the sailors to man them. While the ships are old, they are still serviceable, and with a concerted effort they could be put back into service and make our fleet even more powerful than it is."
AST_pacific_navy:0 "A Navy for the Pacific"

AST_royal_marines:0 "The Royal Marines"

AST_scrap_reserve_desc:0 "Almost half of the larger ships in the Pacific Fleet were mothballed after the Weltkrieg ended, as we simply did not have the sailors to man them. While the ships could be brought back online, the cost of doing so is prohibitive, and thus the decision has been made to abandon them entirely and focus on what we already have in service."
AST_defensive_navy:0 "A Navy for Our Defence"
AST_defensive_navy_desc:0 "Our future naval efforts should focus on keeping our ships close to home, and instead focusing on their speed and defensive abilities. Ours is not an expeditionary force, after all, but one intended to guard our coasts and keep us safe from seaborne invasion."

AST_state_of_RAAF_desc:0 "In truth, there has really been no Royal Australasian Air Force to speak of, and our current planes are barely sufficient in number to guard our own skies never mind project air superiority elsewhere. Considering that the wars of the future will be fought in the air, the government is determined that this must soon change."

AST_expand_air_base:0 "Expand Archerfield"
AST_expand_air_base_desc:0 "Archerfield air base in Queensland is our largest base in the north, and the one that will be best used to project our air power over the entire northern coast. In any situation where we are fighting a potential invader, this is the base that will be most useful for own defence."

AST_improve_equipment:0 "Relics of the Weltkrieg"
AST_improve_equipment_desc:0 "Our infantry's equipment is old, very old. Most of it saw service during the Weltkrieg, and some sets have been around even longer than that. We must equip our army with modern gear, or else we will not stand a chance in another war."
AST_clarify_anzac:0 "Clarify ANZAC"
AST_clarify_anzac_desc:0 "The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps has a long and proud history as one of the best fighting forces in the Empire. Its methods are dated, however, and we should consider carefully what its approach will be going into this new era of warfare."
AST_conscription_plebiscite:0 "Begin the Conscription Plebiscite"
AST_conscription_plebiscite_desc:0 "The enactment of conscription laws will be an unpopular move, one that will be accompanied by cries of 'Remember Gallipoli!' throughout the country. Yet we have dire need to expand our army's enrollment. The best way to move forward would be to hold a national plebiscite on the issue. If it passes, we will have the mandate we need without fear of mass reprisal."
AST_skip_plebiscite:0 "Skip the Conscription Plebiscite"
AST_skip_plebiscite_desc:0 "There is no time to hold a plebiscite on conscription. It must be enacted, whether the people like it or not, and our government will simply have to bear the consequences."

AST_the_new_anzac_desc:0 "Our army is the core of our defence, and emergency measures must be passed to ensure they have access to the best equipment and the best personnel that we can possibly provide. When our enemies see the ANZAC symbol, they should know they face among the very best soldiers the world has to offer."
AST_mobile_focus:0 "Focus on Mobility"
AST_mobile_focus_desc:0 "The quality of our forces do not matter half so much as their mobility. This is a new era, and tactics of encirclement and reach are far more vital to victory than ever before. This must be the focus on Australasia's military future."
AST_tank_penetration:0 "The Sentinel Project"
AST_tank_penetration_desc:0 "Mobility does not mean simply building tanks - there is also the question of mobilising our infantry units, by building mechanised transport which will get them to the front quickly."
AST_equipment_focus:0 "Focus on Quality"
AST_equipment_focus_desc:0 "We do not have the industrial capacity for a large or armoured force. Instead we must focus on keeping Australasia's army small yet well-equipped and well-trained. Size is not as important as quality!"
AST_catering_corps:0 "The Australasian Catering Corps"
AST_catering_corps_desc:0 "Ours is a treacherous land, and it is our military engineers, medics and maintenance companies that often keep entire units alive and on the move. However, as our army expands, so too must our support companies. They are the backbone of our operations, after all."
AST_officer_school:0 "New Officer Training"

AST_jungle_training:0 "Focus on Jungle Combat"
AST_jungle_training_desc:0 "The southern Pacific and Southeast Asia are full of jungles and little more. If this is a field we expect to fight on, then we must prepare our units to fight in them. Special bases should be constructed to that effect in the northern reaches of Queensland, where our jungles are at their most dense."
AST_defense_focus:0 "Focus on Defence"

AST_anderson_doctrine_desc:0 "Former Admiral David Murray Anderson has long called for a renewed commitment to completing what he was unable to in 1925: the reclamation and protection of the British territories in Asia and the Pacific. While dangerously revanchist, this 'Anderson Doctrine' is fast gaining in popularity."
AST_new_guinea:0 "Demand New Guinea"
AST_new_guinea_desc:0 "Port Moresby and the surrounding territory in New Guinea is a vital outpost for our nation, but we will never be secure until the remainder of the island is under our control."
AST_south_pacific:0 "Demand the South Pacific"
AST_south_pacific_desc:0 "Many of the islands in the South Pacific were British or French holdings up until the end of the Weltkrieg. Afterwards they were left in German hands, and it is in our best interest to see them reclaimed."
AST_timor:0 "Demand Timor"
AST_timor_desc:0 "Portuguese Timor is a potential sore spot for our security - in the wrong hands, it is a hostile base right off our northern coast and the perfect spot to launch an invasion."
AST_singapore:0 "Demand Singapore"
AST_singapore_desc:0 "Singapore, on its own, was one of the most important British bases in British Southeast Asia, and the last bastion of our northern efforts during the Weltkrieg until its evacuation at the last possible minute. Regaining control over it would not only be a feather in our cap, it would represent a vital northern base for our country's defence."
AST_north_borneo:0 "Demand North Borneo"

### Events ###

austral.1.t:0 "Status of the Confederation"
austral.1.d:0 "Formed in 1924 as a result of the Consolidation Of Resources Act, the Australasian Confederation is the combination of the British Australasian Dominions, Australia and New Zealand, as well as the territories of British New Guinea and Fiji. The years since the Weltkrieg have brought great change and hardship. The war strained both society and the economy, which in Australia manifested itself in the short lived Melbourne Commune. Although disowned by the then-ruling Labour government and put down by demobilised Australian Imperial Force veterans, this resulted in the implementation of the Emergency Protocols, the suspension of elections, and the appointment of William Birdwood as Governor General. Then the British Revolution of 1925 shook the Empire to the core and Australasia was unable to prevent the loss of territories to the Germans. More than 10 years on, the situation is still unstable as the economy remains stagnant and domestic dissent continues to grow with Birdwood, alongside his ally Billy Hughes' Nationalist Party, barely holding things together."
austral.1.a:0 "Advance Australasia! Onwards!"
austral.2.t:0 "The Oncoming Election"
austral.2.d:0 "Elections in the Antipodes were suspended by the Emergency Protocols, enacted in 1923, which also led to the dissolving of the autonomy of the seperate New Zealand Parliament. However, elections are now set for March this year after Stanley Bruce successfully campaigned for their reintroduction. Governor-General Birdwood was forced to make this concession when Bruce defeated Hughes for the leadership of the Nationalist Party. Bruce's descision not to act as unelected Prime Minister resulted in the expulsion of his faction from the Nationalist Party and Hughes' recall as PM, however the public would not accept the government reneging on its commitments. Australasia can ill afford a repeat of 1923 - as the spectre of Melbourne remains fresh in the minds of many."
austral.2.a:0 "We have to give way to change"
austral.3.t:0 "The Passing of King George V"
austral.3.d:0 "The ousted king of Britain, George V, has finally succumbed to the illness that had plagued him since revolution swept through the home isles. His son, Edward, has ascended the throne of the British Empire, including that of the Australasian dominions. While many in Australasia mourn, there are others for whom the king's death has resurrected memories of the Weltkrieg and the disaster of Gallipoli in particular, and they have taken to the streets to demand a separation of the nation from the British crown as well as the Entente alliance."
austral.3.a:0 "Can they not even respect a state of mourning?"
austral.4.t:0 "A Special Conference of the Labor Party"
austral.4.d:0 "Today the Australasian Labor Party convened a special session in Sydney where the former premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, was readmitted into the party after having been excluded for 5 years. Lang originally left the party and formed his own due to dissagreements with the leadership. After his dismissal from government by the contemporary governor of NSW, Philip Game he fell out of popularity and sought to rejoin the party. A powerful orator and a populist through and through, the readmittance of Lang has caused consternation amongst the more leftist members of the Labor Party who, alongside the majority of trade union activists, see him more as a social feudalist inherently hostile to true socialist doctrine. It seems that the Australasian Labor Party is heading into a turbulent time, given the imminent election."
austral.4.a:0 "Let the leftists squabble amongst themselves!"
austral.5.t:0 "The Australasian Guard"
austral.5.d:0 "Originally formed in 1925, the Australasian Guard is a staunchly nationalist and jingoistic movement, which traces its roots back to the paramilitary organisation the 'League of National Security' comprised of former servicemen returning from the Weltkrieg, who helped put down the 1923 Melbourne Commune. In the years following the Melbourne Uprising, the Guard has continued to support the government, with many supporters joining the expanded security forces available to the Governor-General and assisting in suppressing left-wing activities. The coming return to democratic rule has caused an upset amongst the far right, however, who fear the re-emergence of the long-suppressed Labour movement and that the Nationalist Party, divided as it is, will be unable to maintain the status quo. Due to these factors, the Guard's leader, Eric Campbell, has decided that it will take part in the elections as the Centre Party. Despite their not-inconsiderable levels of popular support, at present it is unsure what impact they will have."
austral.5.a:0 "This can't be good..."
austral.6.t:0 "Victorian Bush Fires"
austral.6.d:0 "The state of Victoria has been hit by heavy bush fires in the north east and south west. Because of intense heat and drought over the last few years, much of rural Victoria has dried up - leaving plenty of fuel for the flames. The fires at this point are so incredibly intense that the ash and smoke can be seen from New Zealand. Firefighters with the aid of the state government are currently trying to combat the disaster, with the flames already threatening several major cities and causing considerable panic."
austral.6.a:0 "Goodness!"
austral.7.t:0 "Bush Fires Finally Extinguished"
austral.7.d:0 "The fires in Victoria have finally been extinguished, thanks to the efforts of local fire fighters as well as overdue dense rainfall. This victory has come at the cost of 71 lives, over 1000 homes destroyed, and the burning of almost 135,500 hectares of land.

Kidman became widely popular due to his support of the government in the Weltkrieg and charitable organisations. The book looks set to be Australasia's best-seller for 1936, and many are drawing parallels between Kidman and the exiled White Rajah, Charles Vyner Brooke, which is sure to boost Brooke's popularity."

austral.12.d:0 "William Birdwood's tenure as Governor-General saw a vast expansion in powers available to the position, which he used to maintain order in Oceania at the expense of democracy and civil liberties. Birdwood, a British General from the Weltkrieg, was imposed upon Australasia by an Empire fearful of revolt... but times have changed, and the newly-elected government could use this opportunity to replace him with a native Australasian. While this move would be popular with many, others have suggested that an opportunity exists to invite a member of the royal family to assume the role and thus put Australasia more firmly within the sphere of the Empire and our fellow Entente allies."

Jack Lang and the moderate right wing of the party are up against the revolutionary left, consolidated around the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. The ACTU wants to seize this opportunity to enact real syndicalist policies throught Australasia, form a republic in memory of the Melbourne Commune, and break from the imperialist Entente. Lang wishes to expel these radicals from the party, maintaining our place in the Empire. Curtin must make a choice: break his party or lead a revolution."

He did not get far into his speech, however, when it was disrupted by syndicalist supporters chanting 'Traitor' and 'Sellout'. Lang at first ignored such taunts but eventually joined in, with every counter-insult he made being followed by cheers and roars from his supporters. When discussing employment Lang had decided to eject the Syndicalists after one remarked 'Didn't you and Beasley turn Australasian workers out of their jobs when you scabbed the party?'. Following this, a violent confrontation broke out between the Syndicalist and Labor supporters. The incident was picked up by the Australasian media, and while their intent was to blame the radicals for their disruption, instead it is Lang who is seen by the public as the one who escalated the confrontation and edged on his supporters."

Paterson spoke of the need for an 'open dialogue' between the unions and the government, and that there was no need to fear the brand of democracy that syndicalism brought.

The government suspects that much of this is orchastrated by syndicalist activists in the Australasian Trade Council Union, but that cannot currently be proven... and, truth be told, support for the syndicalist rhetoric is increasing rapidly.

austral.81.d:0 "Despite the suspension of all official [Root.GetAdjective] trade unions in the country, union leaders have called for general strikes - calls which are being responded to in all major cities. For the past three days, the streets have been flooded with throngs of angry crowds carrying signs decrying the Guard's administration. Police and paramilitary groups have managed to suppress the worst of it, but resistance is expected to continue for at least the next month."

austral.82.d:0 "With the national strikes only recently passed, it was thought that labour unrest was at an end... until a large miner's strike erupted in the southern state of Victoria. Several paramilitary groups, ardent supporters of the Australasian Guard government, descended on the strikers and violently ended it in a clash that left over 25 dead and 60 wounded. While further strikes appear to be unlikely, the government is largely seen as responsible for the bloodshed and it appears to only be a matter of time before activists take up their calls once again."

austral.83.t:0 "Syndicalist Cells Uncovered"
austral.83.d:0 "Finally some good news today as three separate cells of syndicalist agitators were uncovered in major [Root.GetAdjective] cities. Over fifty arrests were made, with public trials expected within weeks, a true blow to the syndicalist movement. There are some, however, who have expressed dismay at how quickly the syndicalists have organised, and suggest that these cells may simply be a few of many in [Root.GetNameDef]."
austral.83.a:0 "Well, it's certainly a start"
austral.84.t:0 "Renewed Protests"
austral.84.d:0 "After a period of quiet, protests have erupted across [Root.GetNameDef] this week - massive marches of thousands, with the crowd in Sydney alone estimated to reach upwards of a hundred thousand people. This is far too much for the [Root.GetAdjective] to disperse without sparking a civil war, and thus so far they have primarily sought to contain things. These are the first protests where syndicalist leader John Curtin has spoke openly, demanding the Australasian Guard government resign in disgrace, and though police have attempted to quietly arrest Curtin so far the crowds have protected him."

austral.85.d:0 "For the second time since the first uprising in 1924, syndicalist supporters have initiated a mass uprising in Melbourne - one that's supported by massive crowds of protestors, calling for the immediate resignation of the Australasian Guard government. The army has squared off against their barricades in the city centre, but the entire nation - indeed, the world - is watching. Either we march in and put down the uprising, triggering massive bloodshed on our fellow Australasians, or we admit defeat and resign."

As before, the Governor General has assumed full command of the nation, forming a temporary government under a chosen prime minister. This intervention does signal at least a return to the previous status quo, and it appears the resignation of the Australasian Guard government has been enough to take the wind out of the uprising. Once again the syndicalists have disappeared into the woodwork and the crisis is passed."
austral.87.a:0 "Whew!"
austral.88.t:0 "The Governor General Refuses"
austral.88.d:0 "As the crisis in Melbourne deepens, the Governor General has indicated a refusal by the [From.GetAdjective] government to either send aid or permit the enactment of the Emergency Protocols. Our mess, they suggest, is one of our own making. It appears we are on our own."

Currently there are two long standing comrades that are worth of such a position. The first is Lance Sharkey, who has had a long-standing relationship with Miles and is unshakable in his orthodox beliefs. The other is the previous leader of the party, Herbert Moxon, who has many years of experience behind him and is one of the syndicalists responsible for the infiltration of the Australasian Labor Party which enabled the revolution.

Jack Henry is quite familar with Paterson, as both were notorious for organising illegal strikes and further expanding syndicalist membership during the early 30's in Queensland, which took on the nickname of 'the Red North'.

Jack Patten, the leader of the organisation and a notable member of AFM, stated 'Give us the chance! We do not wish to be left behind in Australasia's march to progress. We ask for full citizen rights...'.

He legacy however will be one of hardship and determination, which was shown when he, along with Stanley Bruce, continued to push for democratic elections at the risk of dismissal. He was also partially responsible for implementing policies to help alleviate the worst of the depression and, despite the failure of the Nationalists, he was seen fondly amongst many of the general populace for making the best of what he had."

While Sir Anderson has been ill for some time, leaving Sir Phillip Street to fill in for his public appearances, he has been vocal in supporting the Australasian Guard as 'the only right-thinking men in Australasia' who would be capable of enacting his plans to retake the East Indies.
