rusd.1.d:0 "무정부주의자, 사회주의자, 생디칼리스트, 볼셰비키들은 우리 조국의 안보를 약화시키고 있습니다. 최근에는 그들 중 하나가 유명한 장군을 암살하였습니다. 오직 주님만이 그들의 다음 목표를 아실 것이다!"

rusd.3.t:0 "폭탄 테러의 실패"
rusd.3.d:0 "무정부주의자, 사회주의자, 생디칼리스트, 볼셰비키들은 우리 조국의 안보를 약화시키고 있습니다. 최근에 그들은 러시아의 주요 도시 중 한 곳에 암살자를 보내 저명한 정부 대리인을 암살하려하여 도시에 혼란을 일으켰습니다. 다행히 폭탄을 일찍 터져 적은 수의 사람만이 사망하였습니다."

rusd.4.t:0 "농민들의 불안"
rusd.4.d:0 "러시아 역사 통틀어 농민의 생활 여건은 언제나 어려웠고, 심지어 평화와 번영의 시기에도 그러했습니다. 1861년의 농노해방령조차 이런 상황에 아무런 도움을 주지 못하였습니다. 지방 농민들이 이러한 혹독한 환경과 지주들의 불법 행위에 대하여 저항하는 것은 일반적인 일이였습니다."

rusd.5.t:0 "지방에서의 동요"
rusd.5.d:0 "지방이 점차 불안정해지면서, 농민들은 다양한 선동가들에게 영향을 받기 쉬워졌습니다. 실제로 카리스마 있는 활동가가 많은 마을들을 방문하여, 반란을 유도한 사건도 있었습니다. 이 잠재적인 위협에 어떻게 대처하시겠습니까?"
rusd.5.a:0 "내버려둬라 더 중요한 일이 있다!"

rusd.6.t:0 "대규모 농민 준동"
rusd.6.d:0 "다양한 세력들에게 선동된 가난한 농민들이 일어났습니다. 지방 행정 당국은 군중들에게 무력했으며, 이 위기를 모면할 수 있는 유일한 방법은 군대를 동원하는 것뿐입니다. 대안으로 협상을 시도할 수는 있지만, 농민들의 요구를 들어주려면 많은 비용이 들 것입니다."
rusd.6.a:0 "위험을 제거하기위해 군대를 파견한다!"
rusd.6.b:0 "협상을 시도하고 몇몇 요구만 받아들인다."

rusd.7.t:0 "노동 집회"
rusd.7.d:0 "기술 발전은 느려도 꾸준하게 노동 환경을 개선해왔습니다만 노동자들은 여전히 사회주의 선동에 취약합니다. 도시에서는 날마다 집회가 열렸고, 그들의 요구는 선동가에 따라서 제각기 달랐습니다."

rusd.11.t:0 "The Strikers give up!"

rusd.40.t:0 "The Patriarch criticises our Government"
rusd.40.d:0 "Seeing increased displeasure among the common people, the patriarch has decided to voice his concern about the increasing secularisation of our state.

rusd.44.a:0 "A harmless, yet useful ceremony!"

rusd.45.d:0 "A small celebration dedicated to the prosperity of our Motherland has been performed yesterday in one of our towns.

rusd.46.d:0 "A large scale celebration has taken place is our capital.

rusd.50.t:0 "The Acting President Addresses the Duma"
rusd.50.d:0 "After Kerensky's assassination the country is still in chaos.

rusd.52.t:0 "The Patriarch's Demands"
rusd.52.d:0 "Prime Minister-Patriarch Kirill provoked a major crisis and has threatened to resign his position unless the Synod of the Russian Church be allowed to exercise veto power on all new legislation.

rusd.59.t:0 "Kirill Romanov is dead"
rusd.59.d:0 "The Romanov pretender, Kirill Romanov, has died. His son Vladimir is in his early twenties and may make an excellent and pliable figurehead as Tsar. Perhaps now it is time to restore the Monarchy?"
rusd.59.a:0 "Yes, a new Tsar shall promote order and stability!"
rusd.59.b:0 "No. The Tsarist system shall never rise again."

rusd.60.a:0 "Yes, our people will enjoy a spectacular coronation!"

rusd.61.t:0 "The IX Duma Elections"
rusd.61.d:0 "According to the Constitution elections are to be held every five years. Although Kerensky's assassination caused major turmoil in Russia, the VIII Duma has managed to wait out the storm and elections should proceed without interruption. But who will triumph?"

rusd.65.t:0 "The Presidential Elections of 1937"
rusd.65.d:0 "According to our constitution a new President should be elected after Kerensky's assassination. However, political turmoil has caused a delay in the procedure and elections could proceed only after the IX Duma was chosen. Now the time has come to settle the one final dispute in our government. Who should the Senate choose to lead the country?"

rusd.65.b:0 "Vasily Maklakov, the Kadet-Liberal representative."
rusd.65.c:0 "Dmitri Pavlovich Romanov, an aristocratic candidate."
rusd.65.e:0 "Solomon Lozovsky! A modern people's tribune!"

rusd.66.t:0 "SR-Menshevik Coalition breaks up"
rusd.66.d:0 "Kerensky's death meant that the fragile SR-Kadet coalition was no more. Even though the SR-Menshevik coalition has resulted in the two parties gaining considerable influence in the government, ideological differences between the two parties were too great to maintain a coherent coalition, resulting in the Mensheviks leaving the government. This gives way to great possibilities, including a Menshevik-Bolshevik coalition in the near future."
rusd.66.a:0 "Let the Reds quarrel!"
rusd.66.b:0 "Oh no!"

rusd.67.t:0 "Splintering within the Conservatives"
rusd.67.d:0 "Dmitri Romanov's authority and charisma was one of the few things that kept the Russian conservatives strong and vibrant. With his death, the movement quickly split into two branches; the so-called Siloviki, organised around marshal Denikin and consisting mostly of White military officers, and the conservative Civilians, gathered around professor Nikolai Trubetskoy. Without his protector, Yusupov was quickly replaced by Trubetskoy."
rusd.67.a:0 "Let them quarrel!"

rusd.68.t:0 "The X Duma Elections"
rusd.68.d:0 "According to the Constitution elections are to be held every five years. The IX Duma's term has expired and the time has come to elect a new parliament. With the conservatives and left-wing forces in disarray, these elections may lead to surprising results."

rusd.71.c:0 "The Menshevik-Bolshevik Coalition."

rusd.76.d:0 "According to the Constitution elections are to be held every five years. The IX Duma's term has expired and the time has come to elect a new parliament. However, many orthodox Bolsheviks see the Duma as an unnecessary obstacle in building the Communist state. The right-wing sympathisers within the Army are also a problem."
rusd.76.a:0 "Dissolve the Duma and place loyal officers in the Army!"
rusd.76.b:0 "Compromise with the Mensheviks and SR."

rusd.78.t:0 "Tsardom restored"
rusd.78.d:0 "A combined front of Kadets, liberals, and monarchists has managed to topple the Bolshevik republic and restore the monarchy under Vladimir Romanov. What kind of monarchy should it be?"

rusd.78.b:0 "An autocratic monarchy."

rusd.95.t:0 "The Presidential Elections of 1949"

rusd.96.t:0 "Anton Denikin dies"
rusd.96.d:0 "A Hero of the Civil War and the informal leader of Russian conservatives, Anton Ivanovich Denikin, died yesterday in his manor. Although never as radical as his counterpart, Baron Wrangel, Denikin's influence throughout Russia was hard to overestimate. A week of national mourning has been declared as the people bade farewell to one of the few true Heroes of Russia. Grand Admiral Vasily Kanin has been selected to replace him as the head of the Siloviki."
rusd.96.a:0 "Goodbye, Denikin"

rusd.98.t:0 "Pyotr Struve dies"
rusd.98.d:0 "A great liberal and a proponent of the democratic system in Russia, Pyotr B. Struve, has passed away. A member of the Kadet Party and a skilled politician before, during and after the Civil War, Struve shall be remembered as one of the greatest patriots in our history."

However, the young Tsarevich is only 12 so the Prime Minister would have to act as regent until Pavel II comes of age. This means that anti-monarchic elements in the government are likely to make an attempt to overthrow the monarchy and reestablish a republic.

A rabid opponent of Kerensky, he publicly supported Bukharin. As he narrowly followed his son in death many think that his sudden death could be due to the changing political atmosphere in Russia."

Though some of the socialist ideas are implemented in the ideology of the Savinkov's party, the radical syndicalists, who have majority in some Russian regions reject the ideals of the national state. But it turned out that the new government has many loyalists in the others circles of the Russian society. Old friends of Savinkov, the famous philosopher Dmitry Merezhkovsky and his wife Zinaida Gippius have published an appeal to the new leaders of the country. They claimed that Russia must be purified from the internal enemies, who want to spread the chaos and to betray the national interests.

Because we don't forget about our brothers and sisters. The era of the betrayal is over. We are the Phoenix, that was destroyed by the German aggressors, but was reborn. Wait for us. We will come. The Russians should help the Russians' - Though the expansionist plans of Savinkov cannot be realise right now, but this declaration of the unity of the Russian Nation, strongly supported by the Vozhd of the Peasants and the Army shows, that Russia won't avoid the confrontation with the German Empire anymore."

New Russia needs your help in the restoration of its might. Help your country to make it great once again. Glory to Russia and glory to its heroes. It is your country too' - The new national policy of Russia is based on the idea of the supremacy of the Russians, but the idea of the friendship of the nations is popular as well. Savinkov combined these two ideas to secure the interests of the Russians and the minorities, who should be loyal, but also can use all the right of the citizens. This recreation of the old tsarist national policy can finally bring an order and peace to the people of Russia."

Facades of the pavilions of the Russian regions showed the strategic meeting of architectural traditions with the arts and crafts of each part of the country together with motives of important collective labour.

But it is obvious that the government can't allow the left radicals in the State Duma and the monarchists in the Senate use these controversies to destroy the rule of the army and NRPR. To prevent such unwanted events, Savinkov has proposed a recreation of the Supreme Privy Council ('Verkhovnyi Tainyi Sovet'), which once in the Russian history had both executive and legislative power and had consisted of the small number of the most important Russian ministers. Members of the SPC, as known as "Verkhovniki" will consist of 3 party members with Savinkov on the top along with Kornilov and 3 his old comrades from the Russian Army.

Yusupov has proposed to create the united civil and military engineering organisation with him on the top, which will use Yusupov's money as a start-up capital. But in exchange for this necessary investment for our country, Felix asks us to make him the new 'Verkhovnik'."

The power of the Senate should be used as the iron fist in a velvet glove' - with these words the former Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich and now the Head of the Senate Dmitri Romanov demanded an approval of his plan, which is called 'Nashe Delo' ('Our Deal'). According to this program, the powers of the State Duma should be limited, while the Senate will launch the reorganisation of the Russian internal policy and economy.

Though these taxes are really profitable for our economy, but the loyalty of the Senators are highly important for the realisation of the Dmitri Pavlovich's policy. There is a possible solution of this problem - the mansions of some senators can be secured by the Republic as the historical heritage - it means that the Senators will pay the taxes, but the government will partially invest into the maintenance of these buildings."

rusd.158.d:0 "Boris Kamkov, pre-1917 Savinkov's ally and later one of his main enemies, who had became the leader of the Left SRs after the assassination of Maria Spiridonova, died this night in Moscow. It happened when Savinkov's Combat Squads broke into the house, where an illegal Left SR meeting took place, and Kamkov, trying to escape, jumped in the Moscow River and drowned. According to the famous sarcastic writer Ivan Bunin, the 'vox populi' about this incident seems to be sneers or indifference - just like Savinkov and the NRPR want."

rusd.159.t:0 "The Great Crusade"
rusd.159.d:0 "'I'm so delighted with the events of January 1936, with the great heroic deed of the Knight, who raised with his hand the sword to kill the Devil. I believe that this struggle will be continued and our Vozhd will revenge for all these young heroes, who were cowardly killed by the lefts. This struggle must finish with our victory.' - Ivan Shmelyov, Russian conservative writer, whose unarmed son was killed by the Reds at the end of the civil war, demands that Russian government should continue to fight against the left movements, such as Left SRs and Mensheviks not only in Moscow and Petrograd, but also in the various Russian regions. Though these parties were incredibly weakened by special government measures after Savinkov's rise to power and the killing of Maria Spiridonova and Boris Kamkov, their leaders in Russian regions definitely should be arrested and even executed, if necessary."

rusd.160.t:0 "Purge them all?"
rusd.160.d:0 "More than 20,000 Bolsheviks, former Soviet officials, members of the Left SR, and Menshevik party members and leaders were arrested during these past few months. 3,000 of them were already sentenced to the death and executed. But more and more people in Russia, including members of the NRPR, demand that the government should end this policy once and for all. Although Savinkov and the Supreme Privy Council have decided to cease the purges, the question still remains: should these 17,000 people be jailed or should they be executed as enemies of the state?"
rusd.160.a:0 "Imprison them - we are not bloodthirsty Syndicalists after all."
rusd.160.b:0 "Without them Russia will be better - purge them all!"

rusd.161.t:0 "Trial of the 'Left Separatists'"
rusd.161.d:0 "After the end of the Russian Civil War, some of the national minorities, which fought on the side of the Soviets against the White Army continued to disobey the central government, not only with the terrorist methods, but also using the opportunity to take part in the local legislative authorities, where they often found support of the different left movements, such as Mensheviks and part of the Left SRs. This part of the local nationalists became famous as the 'Left Separatists'. Though Boris Savinkov accepted the new national policy, which should regulate and improve the relations between the Russians and the Russian minorities, including groups, unloyal to Petrograd, he can't still forget about the problem of the 'Left Separatists', which still exist even after the prohibition of the Russian Left SR party and its allies. Thanks to our Minister of Security, the leaders, active members and terrorists from the most notorious Left Separatist movements were arrested and their property was nationalised."

orth.1.d:0 "Our Government's religious policies have been popular, both among our own people and abroad. They show how our Faith can bring order and stability to societies in this chaotic modern world. There are now a variety of political groups in neighbouring countries following a new form of politicised Orthodox Christianity. A loose organisation, calling itself 'Faith and Nation', has grown within Russia and is training activists and paramilitaries from these organisations, with the aim of developing their principles and forming an international brotherhood of Orthodox nations. While this could lead to international complications, it may provide an opportunity for Russia to acquire a firm position and role within the world once more."
